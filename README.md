UNDER DEVELOPMENT



Attempt 1: Map the SVG or its container object, canvas, etc. directly onto the geometry

Attempt 2: The ColorPicker's event listeners are split in two, (1) An onChange that updates the sample image color (2) An onSave that mints a NEW svg/png in the DOM with the updated color. The texture for the geometry is then mapped to the path of the new svg/png.
Note: it may be easier to mint to png. 


Idea: A watermark on all non-default previews
